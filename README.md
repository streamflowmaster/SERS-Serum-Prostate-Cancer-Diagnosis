This code project was the core of serum prostate cancer detection utilizing the omics of surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy.
The codes of model, training engine, testing script as well as model weight and partial test dataset were uploaded. 
We encouraged furthermore researches based on our work, so that the dataset of training, validation and external cohort validation can be obtained by request bingsenxue@sjtu.edu.cn.
If you have any question for the code and related technique details, please contact with me without any hesitation.
The authors are full of passion for any cooperation and disscussion about computational spectroscopy and AI for science.
