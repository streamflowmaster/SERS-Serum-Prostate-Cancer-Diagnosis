This code project was the core of serum prostate cancer detection utilizing the omics of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.
The codes of the model, training engine, the testing script as well as the model weight and partial test dataset were uploaded. 
We encouraged furthermore research based on our work, so that the dataset of training, validation, and external cohort validation can be obtained by request bingsenxue@sjtu.edu.cn.
If you have any questions about the code and related technique details, please contact the author without any hesitation.
The authors are full of passion for more cooperation and discussion about computational spectroscopy and AI for science.
